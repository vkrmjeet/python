     control flow:- a program control flow is the order in which a program executes its code .
                    the code should execute from top to bottom and left to right but it can be controlled
                    they are very important
                    they help program to make decision
                    they are regulated by several type of statements
                        i.e conditional statements
                           loops
                           function calls
                    conditional statements:- they will only execute if only certain conditions are true or false
                         ex:- if elif else
                    loops:- they are used to repeat a specific block of code (for and while)
                    function call :- it is a piece of code that does something specific for example print()
