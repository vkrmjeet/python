# paste 20/0 in python console , it will show zero division error

# Print("Hello") it will display name error as "Print" is not defined

# print "hi" it will show missing parenthesis in print

#we can also construct or define our own handler to respond to exceptions that arises in code due to any reason

#number = int(input("enter a whole number: ")) , if we don't enter a whole number it will give an exception
#it will display invalid literal for int as we did input a character
