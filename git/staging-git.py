   more ways to add files in the staging area
      to add file git add . or name of the file
      to remove file from git staging index git rm --cached file_name
    git add *.py any file with this extension will be added to the staging index

    if before commiting the file we check the status of the files in the git bash we will get the status as modified
    for ex this file is already added in the git staging index and i have added this text now if i run the command git status
    it will show this file as modified
     modified:   git/staging-git.py
